GnuspeechSA (Stand-Alone)
=========================

GnuspeechSA is a command-line articulatory synthesizer that converts text
to speech.

GnuspeechSA is a port to C++/C of the TTS_Server in the original Gnuspeech
(http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuspeech/) source code written for NeXTSTEP,
provided by David R. Hill, Leonard Manzara, Craig Schock and contributors.
This project is based on code from Gnuspeech's Subversion repository,
revision 672, downloaded in 2014-08-02. The source code was obtained
from the directories:
nextstep/trunk/ObjectiveC/Monet.realtime
nextstep/trunk/src/SpeechObject/postMonet/server.monet

This software is part of Gnuspeech.

This software includes code from RapidXml (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/),
provided by Marcin Kalicinski. See the file src/rapidxml/license.txt
for details.

Usage of gnuspeech_sa
---------------------

gnuspeech_sa converts the input text to control parameters which will be sent to
the tube model. The tube model then synthesizes the speech.

./gnuspeech_sa [-v] -c config_dir -p trm_param_file.txt -o output_file.wav \
		"Hello world."
	Synthesizes text from the command line.
	-v : verbose

	config_dir is the directory that stores the configuration data,
		e.g. data/en.
	trm_param_file.txt will be generated, containing the tube model
		parameters.
	output_file.wav will be generated, containing the synthesized speech.

./gnuspeech_sa [-v] -c config_dir -i input_text.txt -p trm_param_file.txt \
		-o output_file.wav
	Synthesizes text from a file.
	-v : verbose

	config_dir is the directory that stores the configuration data,
		e.g. data/en.
	input_text.txt contains the input text in english.
	trm_param_file.txt will be generated, containing the tube model
		parameters.
	output_file.wav will be generated, containing the synthesized speech.



Usage of gnuspeech_sa_trm
-------------------------

gnuspeech_sa_trm executes only the tube model.

./gnuspeech_sa_trm [-v] trm_param_file.txt output_file.wav
	-v : verbose

	trm_param_file.txt is the file generated by gnuspeech_sa, containing the
		tube model parameters.
	output_file.wav will be generated, containing the synthesized speech.



Contents of data/en
-------------------

It is recommended that users modify a copy of this directory, not the original.

monet.xml
	Contains the articulatory database.

	It can be modified with a plain text editor, but the use of an editor
	like GS:Editor is recommended.

intonation
	Controls the intonation.

	If random_intonation = 0 in trm_control_model.config, only the first
	line in each tone group will be used. If random_intonation = 1, the
	line will be randomly selected.

MainDictionary
	Contains the main dictionary, which relates words to postures.

trm.config
	Contains the parameters for the tube model.

	Interesting parameters are:
		vocal_tract_length_offset
			This value is added to the vocal tract length.
		loss_factor
			Defines the acoustic loss inside the vocal tract.

trm_control_model.config
	Contains the parameters for the tube model controller.

	Interesting parameters are:

		voice_name
			A value of EXAMPLE will load the voice file named
			voice_EXAMPLE.config.
		tempo
			Values greater than 1 will speed up the speech.
		pitch_offset
			Modifies the voice pitch.

		drift_deviation
		drift_lowpass_cutoff
			Control the random perturbations in the intonation
			(requires intonation_drift = 1).

		dictionary_1_file
		dictionary_2_file
		dictionary_3_file
			Indicate the dictionaries (the dictionaries will be
			searched in the order 1, 2, 3).

	Note:
		The following parameters are not being used at the moment:
			notional_pitch
			pretonic_range
			pretonic_lift
			tonic_range
			tonic_movement

voice_baby.config
voice_female.config
voice_large_child.config
voice_male.config
voice_small_child.config
	Contain the voice parameters.

	Interesting parameters are:

		vocal_tract_length

		glottal_pulse_tp
			Rise time, in % of the period.
		glottal_pulse_tn_min
			Fall time, in % of the period - for the highest pulse
			amplitude.
		glottal_pulse_tn_max
			Fall time, in % of the period - for the lowest pulse
			amplitude.

			These parameters modify the glottal pulse shape.

		reference_glottal_pitch
			Modify the voice pitch.

		breathiness

vowelTransitions
	Controls vowel transitions.

	Normal users should not modify this file.

vowelTransitions_2
	Alternative version of vowelTransitions.
	It is not used.
